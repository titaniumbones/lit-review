# Why Literature Reviews

[![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools)

GivingTuesday is expanding both the scope of its research practice (e.g., doing more and more sophisticated work on non-financial giving) and the domains in which it seeks funding for new interventions (e.g., strengthening civil society). Every time we enter a new domain, we need to understand that terrain as quickly and thoroughly as possible.  This is fundamentally a Knowledge Management problem.

## Scope

Literature reviews are a complex domain (@mccombesHowWriteLiterature2023, @snyderLiteratureReviewResearch2019, etc.). This pilot project is of much more limited scope.  We expect that researchers and fundraisers/business development staff will take our outputs and use them to perform further research and articulation of ideas.  At a future date, we may want to provide different levels of literature review, but for now, are target is as follows:

- **Person-Hours:** a literature review should take about one full day to complete.
- **Authority:** We should have reasonable confidence that the most important sources have been consulted. We should expect that summaries of the literature ore fairly accurate. Clients should understand that our conclusions are provisional and based on a machine-assisted survey of the literature, not on profound expertise. 
- **Output details:** see below.

This repo and the accompanyng mini-site describe a method for rapidly creating preliminary literaature reviews. This system is currently in a **testing phase**, and may produce profound errors. Until we have more confidence in the results it produces, literature reviews should all go through a review process (usually reviewed by Matt; if he is not available, find a replacement at the Director level).

OK -- let's get started!

<!-- > **Note** This is **not** a good example of an actual MyST project! The repositories purpose is to be a simple markdown + notebook repository that can be transformed throughout a tutorial. -->



<!-- > **Tip** Thisi s a tip! -->

<!-- The goals of the [quickstart guide](https://myst.tools/docs/mystjs/quickstart) are: -->

<!-- 1. Create a `myst` site, using the standard template -->
<!-- 2. Improve the frontmatter, to add authors, affiliations and other metadata -->
<!-- 3. Export the paper as a PDF, Word document, and LaTeX files -->
<!-- 4. Integrate a Jupyter Notebook output into our paper, to improve reproducibility -->
<!-- 5. Publish a website of with our work ðŸš€ -->
