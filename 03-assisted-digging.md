# Assisted Digging 

Even a few years ago, the next step would have involved a lot of manual research. Once you have a "seed" collection like the one we've just collected, the trick is to go backwards and forwards through the citation chain, looking for other relevant papers. We look at the **works that our seed articles cited**, and also **the works that have cited them.**  You can do this manually in Google Scholar, but increasingly there are specialized tools for "Literature Mapping."  Some of these, like [LitMaps](https://litmaps.com) and [Scite](https://scite.ai),  can't really be used effectively on the free tiers.  And both of these are quite powerful; scite in particular creates really excellent paper summaries.  But for our purposes, [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com) is an excellent fit, and that's what we'll use for now.

Research Rabbit has an interface in which you can select multiple references and explore their citations, papers that cite them, and also papers that are similar to them and came either before or after their publication.  As you work your way through the interface, you can add new citations to a linked Zotero collection.

After exploring for a while, I end up with 40 resources in the Zotero collection.  So I export the collection again, feed the .bibtex file to Chatgpt, and get a second, slightly different lit review, which looks like this.
