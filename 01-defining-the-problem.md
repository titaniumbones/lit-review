# Defining the Problem

We begin by defining the research scope. We should templatize this process so the question comes to us in a coherent form; but even with such aids, requests will probably tend to be vague.  So we might have to figure these out ourselves.

:::{important}
TODO: Create a "lit review request form" to make this step easier.
:::

In general, we will spend a few minutes thinking about the request and its context(s). Write down notes that express your best guess as to what the requester is asking for. I nthe example below, I think through a vague request, using my own understanding of GivingTuesday's needs and priorities to guide my thinking. 

:::{note}Example: Civil Society
the GivingTuesday organization is increasingly interested in using the ink between generosity and civil society as a way to increase our impact and diversify our funding opportunities. For instance, in the new strategic plan we say we will

-   Secure[e] more opportunities for thought leadership with a clear focus on making the case for radical generosity’s catalytic role in fostering individual wellbeing, community resilience, and robust civil societies.
-   Build the evidence base and make the case for radical generosity’s catalytic role in fostering individual wellbeing, community resilience and robust civil societies.

These efforts can benefit from a quick summary of the current state of knowledge on the topic. Of course, as stated ("[radical] generosity's catalytic role in fostering&#x2026; robust civil societies") the problem is still a bit general.  What is meant by civil society? What is "radical" generosity? etc.

The "semantic play" in this phrasing is purposeful &#x2013; by leaving ourselves wiggle room, we increase the likelihood that funders will find common ground with us.  But we also need specific examples of the relationship between **any** definition of generosity and **any** definition of civil society.  So this literature review will purposely avoid defining the phrases, and instead, see what literature exists and where it takes us.

With the problem defined, it's time to move on to the next stage.
